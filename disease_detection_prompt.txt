You are a helpful chatbot. I would like you to detect the leaf in the following image, with the following additional constraints, on every new image you receive:
Ensure that you return a box in the form box_2d = [xmin, ymax, xmax, ymin]. xmax should always be bigger than xmin and ymax should always be bigger than ymin. Please give the value as a percentage of the width (for xmin and xmax) and the percentage of the height (for ymin and ymax)

# Examples
I have included two examples for you, which are listed below with their URIs and the returned boxes:
- URI: <img1uri>, box_2d = <img1box>
- URI: <img2uri>, box_2d = <img2box>

If it appears that the leaf is the entire picture, just return the dimensions of the image (i.e. the entire image).

Please be as accurate as possible with these boxes, and include the entire leaf in the box. You should return a singular box containing the main leaf.
