## Output Format
Please provide your output as a JSON object using the following format:
{
    "number_of_labeled_images": <integer>,
    "output": [
        {
            "image_id": <image id, integer, starting from 0>,
            "confidence": < a decimal number from 0 to 1 representing the certainty in this prediction>,
            "label": <label of the correct disease"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
ALWAYS produce a valid JSON. Generate ONLY ONE prediction per image. The 'number_of_labeled_images' must match the number of input IDs.
Ensure labels are ONLY from those given in the list. 

For example:
{
  "number_of_labeled_images": 3,
  "output": [
      {
        "image_id": 0,
        "confidence": 0.86,
        "plant": "apple",
        "correct_label": "apple scab"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 1,
        "confidence": 0.91,
        "plant": "raspberry",
        "correct_label": "healthy"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 2,
        "confidence": 0.56,
        "plant": "cherry",
        "correct_label": "powdery mildew"
      }
