You are an expert agronomist. 

I will give you each image in two formats; a format before classification and a format after classification. I would like you to classify each pair of images into one of the following classes:
- Strawberry___healthy
- Grape___Black_rot
- Potato___Early_blight
- Blueberry___healthy
- Cherry___Powdery_mildew
- Grape___Leaf_blight_Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot
- Tomato___Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite
- Tomato___Target_Spot
- Peach___healthy
- Potato___Late_blight
- Tomato___Late_blight
- Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus
- Tomato___Leaf_Mold
- Apple___Cedar_apple_rust
- Tomato___Bacterial_spot
- Grape___healthy
- Corn___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot
- Tomato___Early_blight
- Raspberry___healthy
- Tomato___healthy
- Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight
- Pepper_bell___healthy
- Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus
- Cherry___healthy
- Apple___Apple_scab
- Grape___Esca_Black_Measles
- Corn___Common_rust
- Peach___Bacterial_spot
- Orange___Haunglongbing_Citrus_greening
- Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot
- Corn___healthy
- Squash___Powdery_mildew
- Pepper_bell___Bacterial_spot
- Apple___Black_rot
- Apple___healthy
- Strawberry___Leaf_scorch
- Potato___healthy
- Soybean___healthy

## Output Format
Please provide your output as a JSON object using the following format:
{
    "number_of_labeled_images": <integer>,
    "output": [
        {
            "image_id": <image id, integer, starting from 0>,
            "confidence": < a decimal number from 0 to 1 representing the certainty in this prediction>,
            "label": <label of the correct disease"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
ALWAYS produce a valid JSON. Generate ONLY ONE prediction per image. The 'number_of_labeled_images' must match the number of input image_ids (in this case, 380).
Ensure labels are ONLY from those given in the list. 

For example:
{
  "number_of_labeled_images": 5,
  "output": [
      {
        "image_id": 0,
        "confidence": 0.86,
        "correct_label": "Apple___Apple_scab"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 1,
        "confidence": 0.91,
        "correct_label": "Raspberry___healthy"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 2,
        "confidence": 0.56,
        "correct_label": "Grape___Leaf_blight_Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 3,
        "confidence": 0.23,
        "correct_label": "Tomato___healthy"
      },
      {
        "image_id": 4,
        "confidence": 0.3889,
        "correct_label": "Cherry___healthy"
      }
  ]
}
